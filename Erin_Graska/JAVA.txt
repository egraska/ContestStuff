Note: the host on which this player is run must have java installed and
visible. The Configurator and Client code was compiled with OpenJDK 10.
If this is not compatible with the version of java on the host running
the Configurator and/or Client java application then recompile by
entering the ../src directory and executing 'make'.  This holds for
both the Configurator and the Client.
